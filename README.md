Whats new in AoM?)

- Absolutely free. No exceptions.
- It is oldschool game, where meaning cost more than graphic
- Our well-thought-out economy system is very usefull for increasing players financial and planning skills
- Fun gameplay

Today Age of Merchants is a fast-growing project that became much better every day. But it became hard to make all things done by alone. It would be great if I'll find people people who also have interest in development of games like this. I sure together we could make Age of Merchants - high quality game with very fun and usefull gameplay at the same time
